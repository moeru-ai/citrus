# Project Citrus by Moeru AI

The ultimate goal of the Citrus Project is to develop a model that approaches [Kokoro](https://github.com/hexgrad/kokoro)'s performance while maintaining reproducibility and fine-tuning capability, and ready for anime-style speakers.

But first let's take things step by step...

## Usage

## Q&A

### Why not fine-tune the existing models?

As is well known, Kokoro has not released the fine-tuning scripts, and the author has also closed the Community on HF.

For other models, if your hardware is decent, you can use [Chatterbox Multilingual](https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox) - it's zero-shot is good enough.

That said, once I find a model suitable for fine-tuning, I may also release a Project Citrus fine-tuned version.

### What's the plan?

I plan to start with [StyleTTS2-lite](https://github.com/dangtr0408/StyleTTS2-lite) and [kokoro_training](https://github.com/jonirajala/kokoko_training), modifying it to more closely resemble the original Kokoro structure, and then begin training.
